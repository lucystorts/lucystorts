## Hello! 

#### My name is Lucy Storts and I am currently looking for full-time work in statistics, data science, data analysis, or data visualization.

 I recently graduated with a B.S. in Statistical Science and I am passionate about applying statistical methodologies to real-world scenarios. My academic background has equipped me with expertise in various aspects of statistical analysis, including experimental design, data collection and interpretation, visualization techniques, and statistical programming.

Throughout my college years, I studied many statistical principles and gained practical experience as a Teacher Assistant over multiple semesters. This job required that I know fundamental statistical concepts thoroughly and be ready to answer any question a student might have.

I am proficient in a range of statistical programming languages such as R, Python, SAS, SQL, as well as in tools like MS Word and Excel. I am adept at leveraging these technologies to analyze data and derive meaningful insights. My strong organizational and managerial skills ensure efficient project coordination and meticulous record management, vital for maintaining accuracy and integrity in statistical analyses.

I have a passion for exploring the applications of statistical science in diverse fields and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to projects that require rigorous analysis and data-driven decision-making.

Some of my professional interests include...
- Statistics
- Data Science
- Data Visualization
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Machine learning
- Data Ethics
- Epidemiology
- Healthcare
- Genetics

I believe the ‚Äúhard-to-answer‚Äù questions can be answered through data science processes and I am excited to share and apply what I‚Äôve been studying to real world situations.
