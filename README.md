## Hello! 

#### My name is Lucy and I am a senior studying Statistics at Brigham Young University.  This is my last semester of school and I am very excited to be graduating in *December 2023!*

I took a statistics class in high school and was fascinated by all the different fields statistics can be applicatied to and I hope to be able to work with data of all kinds. 

Some of my professional interests include...
- epidemiological data
- climate change
- women‚Äôs health
- healthcare data
- bioinformatics
- application of machine learning to the study of genetics

I believe the ‚Äúhard-to-answer‚Äù questions can be answered through data collection and analysis, and I am excited to share and apply what I‚Äôve been studying to solve real world problems.
